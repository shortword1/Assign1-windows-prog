MP3 Player and Tagger
This WPF application, developed in C# using Visual Studio, serves as an MP3 player and tag editor. 
It allows users to open, play, pause, stop, and navigate through a list of recently played songs. 
Additionally, the application features the ability to edit and save MP3 tags like title, artist, album, and year directly within the interface. 
The GUI includes a media player for audio playback, a display for album art, and a list view to access recent songs. 
Users can also view and modify song metadata, including the title, artist, album, and year, enhancing their music library's organization.
